# roco2
A synthetic workload generator written in C++ with integrated [Score-P](http://www.vi-hps.org/projects/score-p) instrumentation.

## Notes on this fork
This is a fork to get a simple experiment running. Several parts of the original roco2 have been severed or disabled.

Build with:

```
mkdir build && cd build
SCOREP_WRAPPER_INSTRUMENTER_FLAGS='--user --openmp --thread=omp --nocompiler' SCOREP_WRAPPER=off cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=scorep-gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=scorep-g++ -DUSE_SCOREP=ON -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
make SCOREP_WRAPPER_INSTRUMENTER_FLAGS='--user --openmp --thread=omp --nocompiler'
```

## Getting started

The folder ```src/configurations/example``` contains one example configuration.
You can build this example, however it will require small adjustments to fit your machine. (See [Build](#user-content-building-with-cmake))

The file ```src/configurations/example/experiment.cpp``` contains all configuration,
which is necessary to adapt to your machine. For simple adjustments, you can edit the section ```EDIT GENERIC SETTINGS```. This section comprises the variables representing the duration of one experiment, a list of all tested frequencies and T-states, and the patterns of the active hardware threads. These four knobs determine the length of one execution.
For more fine grained changes to the execution, you can edit the section ```EDIT TASK PLAN```. This section determines the order of execution for the different workload kernels.

-   [Score-P](http://www.vi-hps.org/projects/score-p)
-   libnuma
-   libcpufreq
-   [X86Adapt](https://github.com/tud-zih-energy/x86_adapt)
